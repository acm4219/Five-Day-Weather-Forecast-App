## Five Day Weather Forecast

### Description
This application is used to look into the upcoming weather for your city up to five days. For every city that you look up you're able to go back to for the weather and cycle between the searches at a click. In the weather section you'll be able to see: the date, current weather condition, the icon, the temperature, humidity and windspeed.

### Usage
To begin you simply enter in your city of choice into the search bar and hit the submit button. From there the weather for the next five days will populate the boxes and main card showing the weather in all boxes up to five days ahead. When the submit is clicked it creates a button of your search that you can click to recall the search and pull the information to the screen. 

### Challenges
Unfortunately I was not able to include the UV section of the project as I wasn't sure how to include multiple API's into one Javascript. This is definitely something that I intend to learn about and get set up so the app works to it's full potential. Additionally I was not able to get it to stay on the current day as the forecast API wasn't set to the current day but the day ahead. Still it does provide the upcoming weather in full. Finally I wasn't able to keep the main information from the last search on the screen as I ran out of time to figure it out. I plan on learning how to do that properly as well when there is a bit more time. 

### Credits
I was able to create what the application from working with our instructor and TA's at the bootcamp as well as learning some concepts while in discussion with some classmates.
